# Firewalls & Authenticator

We built a login form with a traditional route, controller and template. And so
you *might* expect that because the form submits back to this same URL, the submit
logic would live right inside this controller:

[[[ code('695952a844') ]]]

Like, if the request method is POST, we would grab the email, grab the password and
do some magic.

## What are Authentication Listeners / Authenticators?

Well... we are *not* going to do that. Symfony's security works in a bit of a
"magical" way, at least, it feels like magic at first. At the beginning of every
request, Symfony calls a set of "authentication listeners", or "authenticators".
The job of each authenticator is to look at the request to see if there is any authentication
info on it - like a submitted email & password or maybe an API token that's stored
on a header. *If* an authenticator finds some info, it then tries to use it to find
the user, check the password if there is one, and log in the user! *Our* job is to
write these authenticators.

## Understanding Firewalls

Open up `config/packages/security.yaml`. The *most* important section of this
file is the `firewalls` key:

[[[ code('942e4ef121') ]]]

Ok, what the heck is a "firewall" in Symfony language? First, let's back up.
There are *two* main parts of security: authentication and authorization.
Authentication is all about finding out *who* you are and making you prove it.
It's the login process. Authorization happens after authentication:
it's all about determining whether or not you have access to something.

The *whole* job of the firewall is to *authenticate* you: to figure out who you are.
And, it *usually* only makes sense to have *one* firewall in your app, *even* if
you want your users to have *many* different ways to login - like a login form
or API authentication.

But... hmm... Symfony gave us *two* firewalls by default! What the heck? Here's
how it works: at the beginning of each request, Symfony determines the *one* firewall
that matches the current request. It does that by comparing the URL to the regular
expression `pattern` config. And if you look closely... the first firewall is a fake!

[[[ code('4c41489db1') ]]]

It becomes the active firewall if the URL starts with `/_profiler`, `/_wdt`, `/css`,
`/images` or `/js`. *When* this is the active firewall, it sets security to `false`.
Basically, this firewall exists *just* to make sure that we don't make our site
*so* secure that we block the web debug toolbar or some of our static assets.

In reality, we only have *one* real firewall called `main`:

[[[ code('f7ec5ea472') ]]]

And because it does *not* have a `pattern` key, it will be the active firewall
for *all* URLs, except the ones matched above. Oh, and, in case you're wondering,
the names of the firewalls, `dev` and `main` are totally meaningless.

Anyways, because the job of a firewall is to authenticate the user, most of the config
that goes below a firewall relates to "activating" new authentication listeners -
those things that execute at the beginning of Symfony and try to log in the user.
We'll add some new config here pretty soon.

Oh, and see this `anonymous: true` part?

[[[ code('e09d08a770') ]]]

Keep that. This allows *anonymous* requests to pass through this firewall so that
users can access your public pages, without needing to login. *Even* if you want
to require authentication on *every* page of your site, keep this. There's a different
place - `access_control` - where we can do this better:

[[[ code('ca4f64d436') ]]]

## Creating the Authentication with make:auth

Ok, let's get to work! To handle the login form submit, we need to create our very
first authenticator. Find your terminal and run `make:auth`:

```terminal-silent
php bin/console make:auth
```

***TIP
Since MakerBundle v1.8.0 this command asks you to choose between an "Empty authenticator"
and a "Login form authenticator". Choose the first option to follow along with the tutorial exactly.
Or choose the second to get more generated code than the video!
***

Call the new class `LoginFormAuthenticator`.

Nice! This creates one new file: `src/Security/LoginFormAuthenticator.php`:

[[[ code('4c53e58309') ]]]

This class is awesome: it basically has a method for each step of the authentication
process. Before we walk through each one, because this authenticator will be for
a login form, there's a different base class that allows us to... well... do less
work!

Instead of `extends AbstractGuardAuthenticator` use `extends AbtractFormLoginAuthenticator`:

[[[ code('bb12700cb9') ]]]

I'll remove the old `use` statement.

Thanks to this, we no longer need `onAuthenticationFailure()`, `start()` or
`supportsRememberMe()`: they're all handled for us:

[[[ code('f14f31f028') ]]]

But don't worry, when we create an API token authenticator later, we *will* learn
about these methods. We *do* now need one *new* method. Go to the "Code"->"Generate"
menu, or `Command`+`N` on a Mac, and select "Implement Methods" to generate `getLoginUrl()`:

[[[ code('10fb7f5cda') ]]]

## Activating the Authenticator in security.yaml

Perfect! Unlike a lot of features in Symfony, this authenticator won't be activated
automatically. To tell Symfony about it, go *back* to `security.yaml`. Under the
`main` firewall, add a new `guard` key, a new `authenticators` key below that,
and add one item in that array: `App\Security\LoginFormAuthenticator`:

[[[ code('8b2d8c862a') ]]]

The whole authenticator system comes from a part of the Security component called
"Guard", hence the name. The important part is that, as *soon* as we add this,
at the beginning of *every* request, Symfony will call the `supports()` method on
our authenticator.

To prove it, add a `die()` statement with a message:

[[[ code('f8759ff1c8') ]]]

Then, move over and, refresh! Got it! And it doesn't matter *what* URL we go to:
the `supports()` method is always called at the start of the request.

And now, we're in business! Let's fill in these methods and get our user logged in.
